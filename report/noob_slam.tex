\section{SLAM algorithms}

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM for short) algorithms are a very powerful class of algorithms, 
allowing robots to better interact with their environment. 

\section{Robot}

The use-case in this article will be for a small, simple robot to run the algorithm on in order to navigate
a student dorm and find it's base station to recharge.
